        <span id="one">Life is short, </span> 
        and I've shortened mine
        in a thousand delicious, ill-advised ways,
        a thousand deliciously ill-advised ways
        I'll keep from my children. The world is at least
        fifty percent terrible, and that's a conservative
        estimate, though I keep this from my children.
        For every bird there is a stone thrown at a bird.
        For every loved child, a child broken, bagged,
        sunk in a lake. 
        <span id="one">Life is short</span> 
        and the world is at least half terrible, and for every kind
        stranger, there is one who would break you,
        though I keep this from my children. I am trying
        to sell them the world. Any decent realtor,
        walking you through a real shithole, chirps on
        about good bones: This place could be beautiful,
        right? <span id="two">You could make this place beautiful.</span>
