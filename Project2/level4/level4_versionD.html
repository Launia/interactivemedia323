            Life is <span>short</span>, though I keep this from my children.
            Life is short, and I've <span>shortened</span> mine
            in a thousand delicious, ill-advised ways,
            a thousand <span>deliciously</span> ill-advised ways
            I'll keep from my children. The world is at least
            fifty percent terrible, and that's a conservative
            estimate, though I keep this from my children.
            For every bird there is a stone <span>thrown</span> at a bird.
            For every loved child, a child broken, bagged,
            <span>sunk</span> in a lake. Life is short and the world
            is at least half terrible, and for every kind
            stranger, there is one who would <span>break</span> you,
            though I keep this from my children. I am trying
            to sell them the world. Any decent realtor,
            walking you through a real <span>shithole</span>, chirps on
            about good bones: This place could be beautiful,
            right? You could make this place <span>beautiful</span>.
