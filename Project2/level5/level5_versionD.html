        <div>Life is short,</div>
        <div>though I keep this from my children.</div>
        <div>and I've shortened mine</div>
        <div>in a thousand delicious, ill-advised ways,</div>
        <div>a thousand deliciously ill-advised ways</div>    
        <div>I'll keep from my children.</div>
        <div> The world is at least fifty percent terrible,</div>
        <div>and that's a conservative estimate,</div>
        <div>though I keep this from my children.</div> 
        <div>For every bird there is a stone thrown at a bird.</div>      
        <div>For every loved child,</div>
        <div>a child broken, bagged,</div>
        <div>sunk in a lake.</div>
        <div>Life is short and the world is at least half terrible,</div>
        <div>and for every kind stranger,</div>
        <div>there is one who would break you,</div>
        <div>though I keep this from my children.</div>
        <div>I am trying to sell them the world.</div>
        <div>Any decent realtor,</div>
        <div>walking you through a real shithole,</div>
        <div>chirps on about good bones:</div>
        <div>This place could be beautiful, right?</div>    
        <div>You could make this place beautiful.</div>
